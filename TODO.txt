- (high) Create Climate Control mod
- (medium) Prepare SMAPI environment with useful mods e.g. CJB Cheats
- (medium) Prepare for modular design
	- Add classes for modules as they are designed
	- Include checks for presence of sister mods before calling relevant methods
	- (DONE) First sister mod: Climate Control for weather probabilities
	- Add submodules to git repository so users can find them easily
	- (DONE) Investigate VS ability to build projects independently of solutions [Can do this easily, each project is built as a separate mod. Make sure that project name matches mod name in manifest (and probably good practise to match to cs name too). Also, can set solution's startup projects so that all of them are built together.]
- (low) Add integration with GMCM
- (DONE) Add functionality to predict upcoming weather
- (DONE) Arrange code into methods [classes now!]
